# Layout and geometry

In this technique project weâ€™re going to explore how SwiftUI handles layout. Some of these things have been explained a little already, some of them you might have figured out yourself, but many more are things you might just have taken for granted to this point, so I hope a detailed exploration will really shed some light on how SwiftUI works.
