# Temperature converter
This is a challange day, the challange is:

*You need to build an app that handles unit conversions: users will select an input unit and an output unit, then enter a value, and see the output of the conversion.*

I've decided to make temperature converter app. User can choose between kelvin, celsius and fahrenheit.
