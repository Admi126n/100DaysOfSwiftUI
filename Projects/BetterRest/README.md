# Better rest

This SwiftUI project is another forms-based app that will ask the user to enter information and convert that all into an alert, which might sound dull – you’ve done this already, right?

Well, yes, but practice is never a bad thing. However, the reason we have a fairly simple project is because I want to introduce you to one of the true power features of iOS development: machine learning (ML).
