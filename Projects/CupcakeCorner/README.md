# Cupcake corner
In this project we’re going to build a multi-screen app for ordering cupcakes. This will use a couple of forms, which are old news for you, but you’re also going to learn how to make classes conform to Codable when they have @Published properties, how to send and receive the order data from the internet, how to validate forms, and more.
