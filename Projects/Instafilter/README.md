# Instafilter
In this project we’re going to build an app that lets the user import photos from their library, then modify them using various image effects. We’ll cover a number of new techniques, but at the center of it all are one useful app development skill – using Apple’s Core Image framework – and one important SwiftUI skill – integrating with UIKit. There are other things too, but those two are the big takeaways.
