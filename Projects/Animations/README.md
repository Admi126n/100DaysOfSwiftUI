# Animations
We’re back to another technique project, and this time we’re going to be looking at something fast, beautiful, and really under-valued: animations.

Challange on day 34:
Go back to the Guess the Flag project and add some animation:
- When you tap a flag, make it spin around 360 degrees on the Y axis.
- Make the other two buttons fade out to 25% opacity.
- Add a third effect of your choosing to the two flags the user didn’t choose – maybe make them scale down? Or flip in a different direction? Experiment!
